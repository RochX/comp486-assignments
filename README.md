# comp486-assignments
Repository that contains my assignments for COMP-486 machine learning (winter 2024).
Assignments are either written in LaTeX or in a Jupyter notebook.

The repository also contains class notes in the `notes` folder.
Jupyter notebooks from our textbook are within the `notebooks` folder.
See [https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3) for the original Jupyter notebooks from the textbook.
