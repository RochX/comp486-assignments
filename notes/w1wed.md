### What is machine learning?
Keywords: experience, task, performance measure

Experience: data

Task: What we do with the data

Performance measure: *Predicting* new data based upon the training

### First Big Application of Machine Learning
Spam filter

Take in a large number of labeled data (i.e. emails).
The emails have their own features that the model will look at, such as whether the email has a link in it.
Model takes in features $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ and gives an output $y$.
Think of $y$ as the desired output; is it spam or not spam?.

### Example: A Chess Learning Problem
What is the:
- Task: Winning at Chess
- Experience: Games played
- Performance measure: How often it wins

### Why Machine Learning?
Easy to automate

## Summarizing
Introductions, Going over syllabus, project, basics of machine learning

## For Friday
We will start learning about models.
Read the material and start assignment 1.
